## 🤝 How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues. When creating a bug report, include:

- **Clear title and description**
- **Steps to reproduce** the problem
- **Expected behavior** vs actual behavior
- **Python version** and OS
- **Sample `.pyc` file** if possible (or describe the bytecode pattern)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, include:

- **Clear title and description**
- **Use case** and why it would be useful
- **Mockups or examples** if applicable

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code, add tests
3. Ensure the test suite passes
4. Make sure your code follows the style guidelines
5. Write a clear commit message

## 🛠️ Development Setup

1. **Clone your fork:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-bytecode-analyzer.git
cd smart-bytecode-analyzer
```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the application:**
```bash
python analyzer.py
```

## 📝 Coding Guidelines

### Python Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to classes and functions
- Keep functions focused and small
- Maximum line length: 100 characters

### Code Structure

```python
class MyClass:
    """Brief description.
    
    Detailed description if needed.
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        """Initialize the class."""
        pass
    
    def my_method(self, param):
        """
        Brief description of what the method does.
        
        Args:
            param: Description of parameter
            
        Returns:
            Description of return value
        """
        pass
```

### Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests

Examples:
```
Add support for Python 3.15 bytecode
Fix stack simulation for BINARY_OP
Update GUI layout for better UX
```

### Testing

- Test your changes thoroughly
- Include test cases for bug fixes
- Test with multiple Python versions if possible
- Check both GUI and CLI modes

## 📤 Submitting Changes

1. **Push to your fork:**
```bash
git push origin feature/my-feature
```

2. **Open a Pull Request:**
   - Clear title describing the change
   - Reference related issues
   - Describe what changed and why
   - Include screenshots for UI changes

3. **Code Review:**
   - Be open to feedback
   - Make requested changes promptly
   - Keep the PR focused on one feature/fix

## 🐛 Areas That Need Help

- **Python Version Support**: Testing with different Python versions
- **Bytecode Patterns**: Identifying and handling new patterns

- **Documentation**: Examples, tutorials, API docs
- **Testing**: More comprehensive test coverage
- **UI/UX**: GUI improvements and user feedback

## 🎯 Priority Areas

1. **High Priority:**
   - Bug fixes for reconstruction errors
   - Support for new Python releases
   - Critical security issues

2. **Medium Priority:**
   - Performance improvements
   - New export formats
   - Enhanced pattern recognition

## 💡 Development Tips

### Testing Bytecode Patterns

Create test `.pyc` files:
```python
import py_compile
py_compile.compile('test.py', 'test.pyc')
```

### Debugging

Enable debug mode:
```bash
python analyzer.py --debug
```
